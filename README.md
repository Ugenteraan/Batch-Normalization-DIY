# Batch Normalization

In DIY Batch Normalization with EMA.ipynb, I've implemented a simple batch normalization technique using MNIST dataset manually. To estimate the population mean and population variance, I've used exponential moving average technique.

In Tensorflow built-in Batch Normalizatio.ipynb, I've implemented the tensorflow's built-in module to perform a simple batch normalization on the same model as before.
